    <h1>Goats!</h1>

    <p>
        Goats are amazing creatures. They eat grass and have horns and cool little beards.
        Goats can be eaten as well as milked for milk. Awesome products can be made from their milk, such as cheese and soap.
        There are also pygmy goats which are tiny and cool.
